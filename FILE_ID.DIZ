XBOOT 2.0 (c) 1996 by EBCEEB,inc.

This program configures menu in master
boot record of your hard disk and allow
select operating system after RESET
(Unix/OS2/Win95 or DOS/DRDOS/PCDOS or...)

It's best analog (very compact & fast)
of BootAny, Linux and OS/2 boot manager !

Nice interface, install and re-confugure.

Some additional disk tools.

Fully source codes (PAS, ASM) and russian doc.
